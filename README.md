# Operating-Systems-Linux-Final-Project
This project is a Linux Operating Systems assignment that simulates how companies manage employee accounts in a Linux environment. The script reads employee information from a CSV file and automatically performs onboarding for employees who are marked as active and offboarding for employees who are marked as terminated. The main idea is to show how real IT environments automate user management, reduce manual work, and keep everything documented with logs and reports.

The main data source of the system is the employees.csv file, which includes employee_id, username, name_surname, department, and status fields. The status field is especially important because it decides the action: if an employee is active, they should exist on the system; if they are terminated, they should lose access. By comparing the current CSV with the previously saved snapshot file, the script is able to automatically detect newly added users, removed users, and terminated users and handle them accordingly.

Before running, the script is made executable using chmod +x employee_lifecycle_sync.sh, and then it is started with ./employee_lifecycle_sync.sh. When it runs, it creates department groups if they don’t exist, creates Linux users, adds them to their departments, archives home directories of terminated employees, locks their accounts, and ensures user access is correctly managed like in a real corporate environment.

While running, the script automatically creates an output directory. Inside it, logs contains detailed execution logs showing every step, reports contains summary manager reports that show how many users were added or offboarded, and archives is used to store compressed backups of terminated users. This structure makes the process organized, understandable, and easy to follow.

In summary, this project provides an automated employee lifecycle management system on Linux. It detects changes, handles onboarding and offboarding, generates logs and reports, and clearly demonstrates topics such as Linux system administration, shell scripting, automation, and lifecycle management in a realistic but student-friendly way.
